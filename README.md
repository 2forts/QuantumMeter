# Code for [A framework for quantum circuit optimization: comparators as a case study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=92)

**Francisco Orts and Rodrigo Gil-Merino**

This repository contains all the written code for the paper "blablabla". It allows simplifying quantum circuits under certain assumptions.

The code is written in Python. These libraries are necessary:
