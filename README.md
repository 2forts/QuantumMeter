# Code for [A framework for quantum circuit optimization: comparators as a case study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=92)

**Francisco Orts and Rodrigo Gil-Merino**

This repository contains all the written code for the paper "A framework for quantum circuit optimization: comparators as a case study", written by Francisco Orts and Rodrigo Gil-Merino. It allows simplifying quantum arithmetic circuits and, in general, any quantum circuit that computes an operation between two bit strings $A$ and $B$ whose operation is based on Boolean algebra.

The code is written in Python. These libraries are necessary:
* qiskit
* collections
